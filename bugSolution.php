The solution lies in consistently defining your array keys explicitly. Avoid relying on PHP's implicit assignment, especially when combining string and numeric keys. For instance, replace the problematic line in the `bug.php` example:

```php
$myArray[] = 30; // Problematic line
```

with something like:

```php
$myArray[2] = 30; // Explicit key assignment
```

This ensures that keys are assigned predictably, preventing unexpected numeric index assignments.  Here's a refined version in `bugSolution.php` demonstrating explicit key definition:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = 10;
$myArray[1] = 20;
$myArray[2] = 30; // Explicitly assigned key

echo "Value of key1: " . $myArray["key1"] . "\n"; // Outputs 10
echo "Value of 1: " . $myArray[1] . "\n"; // Outputs 20
echo "Value of 2: " . $myArray[2] . "\n"; // Outputs 30 (Now predictable)
?>
```
By explicitly managing keys, you enhance code clarity, predictability, and avoid potential errors stemming from PHP's implicit key generation.
